## 🔗 Integration Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Login Button Redirection
- **Marketing site login button** now redirects to **admin portal login page**
- Configured via environment variables for flexibility
- Works on both desktop and mobile versions

### 2. ✅ Form Submission to Backend
- **Request a Call form** on marketing site now saves to database
- Real-time form validation and submission feedback
- Success/error messages for user experience
- Form resets after successful submission

### 3. ✅ Incoming Jobs Page in Admin Portal
- New **"Incoming Jobs"** page in admin portal sidebar
- Displays all job requests from marketing website
- Features include:
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Status management (New, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
  - Technician assignment
  - Notes addition
  - Job deletion
  - Detailed view modal

### 4. ✅ Unified Backend API
- Single backend serves both marketing site and admin portal
- New API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/marketing/job-request` - Submit job request (no auth)
  - `GET /api/incoming-jobs` - List incoming jobs (auth required)
  - `PUT /api/incoming-jobs/:id` - Update job request (auth required)
  - `DELETE /api/incoming-jobs/:id` - Delete job request (auth required)
- CORS configured for both frontends
- New database model: `IncomingJobRequest`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Start all applications:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the applications:**
   - Marketing Site: http://localhost:5174
   - Admin Portal: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## 📋 Environment Setup Required

Create these `.env` files:

**packages/backend-api/.env:**
```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/call-a-technician
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
MARKETING_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
```

**apps/marketing-site/.env:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_PORTAL_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**apps/admin-portal/.env:**
```env

```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

1. **Customer visits marketing site** → Sees "Request a Call" form
2. **Customer submits form** → Data saved to database via API
3. **Admin logs into portal** → Clicks "Incoming Jobs" in sidebar
4. **Admin manages jobs** → Updates status, assigns technicians, adds notes
5. **Admin can delete jobs** → Clean up completed requests

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Unified codebase** - Easier to maintain and deploy
- **Shared backend** - Single source of truth for data
- **Seamless integration** - Marketing site and admin portal work together
- **Real-time updates** - Form submissions appear immediately in admin portal
- **Professional workflow** - Complete job request management system
